### Hexlet tests and linter status:

# Welcome to my incredible college project

in this project i had to make some console games and then record videos of me playing them and showing all the outcomes... enjoy!

## Installation

before the installation make sure you have [node js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

With that out of the way copy this into your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/herman-makarkin/frontend-project-44.git
cd ./frontend-project-44
make install
```

now after typing this command you should see the following output

```
make brain-games
```

(i'm too lazy to configure the fonts in asciinema)
